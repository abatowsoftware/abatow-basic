# Abatow Basic
**Offline E-Voting Software**

**Version:** v1.0.0-Beta  
**Developer:** Abatow Software

Abatow Basic is a free, offline-first, single-election electronic voting application built for small organizations, schools, clubs, unions, and community groups. It provides a simple and secure way to conduct elections on a local machine.

Abatow Basic operates offline **except for one step**:  
Internet is required **only when the user chooses to send minimal tracking data** (number of voters, application version, anonymous client ID) by clicking **“I agree, Send.”**  
All other functions remain completely offline.

## 🌐 Local Network Voting
When an election begins, **Abatow Basic starts a local web server on port 443**.  
Voters can participate using any modern web browser on any device connected to the **same local network**.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Offline election management  
- Local network browser-based voting  
- Internet required **only** when sending optional tracking data

Download the latest version from the Releases page.

## 🔒 Privacy & Tracking
Abatow Basic stores all election data locally.

The **only** time the software uses the internet is when the user clicks:  
**“I agree, Send.”**

At that moment, the following is sent:
- Number of voters  
- Application version  
- Anonymous client ID  

No ballots, results, candidate information, or sensitive data are ever transmitted.
